<h1>CHANGELOG - List of Changed Files </h1>
<p>For a list of files that have been changed since v1.3.8, see the <a href="changelog-v1-3-9.html" target="_blank">changelog-v1-3-9.html</a> </p>
<h1>*** SECURITY REQUIREMENT ***</h1>
<p>For added security, Zen Cart&trade; comes with several .htaccess files already included in various folders to help provide protection against unwanted visitors 
and even against mis-use of your site in the unfortunate situation of your site being hacked. These protections prevent hackers from using your site as phishing sources.</p>
<p>However, for these built-in protections to work, your web hosting server administrator MUST set the AllowOverride directive 
in the server's apache configuration (the server's master httpd.conf file)  to "All" or at least ensure it includes these parameters: 'Limit Options Indexes'.<br />
<pre>ie:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AllowOverride All<br />
or: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AllowOverride Limit Options Indexes</pre><br />
Without these settings, you will likely encounter "<strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>" messages when attempting to access various parts of your site, including perhaps the zc_install installer script.
 </p>
<p>Storeowners hosting on Windows Servers using IIS instead of Apache may need to remove the .htaccess files and rework them into suitable equivalents within your IIS configuration. See Microsoft's IIS website for specific assistance.</p>
<h1>Zen Cart&trade; Minimum Requirements</h1>
<p>PHP 4.3.2 or higher, Apache 1.3.30 and MySQL 3.23.x or higher.</p>

<h1>Upgrade Instructions from v1.3.8 to 1.3.9</h1>
<p>If you are upgrading <strong><u>from Zen Cart v1.3.8</u></strong>, the process is simple:<br>
  - compare all the changed files with the files on your own site... and re-apply your customizations to the new files<br>
  - upload the new files (with your customizations added) to your site<br>
  - upload the <span class="filename">zc_install</span> folder to your server, and run <span class="filename">zc_install/index.php</span> <br>
  ... select <strong>Database Upgrade</strong> from the System Inspection screen. Apply the required updates. </p>
<p>If you are upgrading <strong><u>from a version prior to v1.3.8</u></strong>, please follow the instructions in the &quot;<a href="2.readme_how_to_upgrade.html">how to upgrade</a>&quot; documentation in the /docs folder. </p>
<h1>IMPORTANT NOTES </h1>
<ul>
<li><span class="style1">SECURITY:</span><span class="error"> Please be sure to review and apply the <a href="./important_site_security_recommendations.html" target="_blank">Site Security Recommendations</a> to your site prior to taking your shop &quot;live&quot;.</span> If you are uncertain about how site security applies to you, talk to your web host to ensure that you have proper measures in place. <br>
<br>
</li>
  <li><span class="style1">PAYMENT MODULES:</span> <span class="error">Many changes have been made to the Authorize.net (SIM/AIM/eCheck), PayPal (IPN/Standard/Pro/Express), Linkpoint/FirstData payment modules. <strong> If you are using any of these modules</strong>, you will need to Remove and re-Install the modules via Admin-&gt;Modules-&gt;Payment in order for them to work properly.</span> (Write down your settings first, for easier re-configuration!) <br>
        <em>If you don't remove+reinstall them, you will have some blank spaces in your configuration settings when you attempt to edit them next.</em> <br>
<br>
ALSO: NOCHEX and Offline CC Module have been removed from core for PCI/PA-DSS reasons.
</li><br />
<li><strong class="style1">SHIPPING MODULES</strong> All the built-in shipping modules have been updated. <br /><span class="error">For EACH one that you're using, you will need to Remove and re-Install the module in Admin-&gt;Modules-&gt;Shipping in order to make them work properly.</span> (Write down your settings first, for easier re-configuration!) <br>
<br>
</li>
<li><strong class="style1">ORDER TOTAL modules</strong> ...<span class="error">All the OT modules have been updated with fixes.<br>You will need to Remove and re-Install each module in Admin-&gt;Modules-&gt;Order Total in order to make them work properly.</span> (Write down your settings first, for easier re-configuration!) <br>

</ul>
<h1>UPGRADING YOUR TEMPLATES </h1>
Since version 1.2, Zen Cart&trade; has had a major overhaul of the templating system for v1.3.  As such, you have two options:
<ul>
<li>upgrade your existing template by applying the new stylesheet and moving a few lines of code around; or</li>
<li><strong>the best way </strong>to have almost-tableless and much tidier template code, is to <strong>make a new template</strong> (based on template_default or the new &quot;green&quot; classic introduced in v1.3.5) and carefully re-apply your own customizations to the new template system.</li>
</ul>


<p>For further information on template upgrading, see the support-forum discussion on this topic. </p>
<br />
<p><strong>1.3.9 Template changes</strong> (since 1.3.8) have been minimal. Simply merge the changes with any of your override versions.</p>

<h1>Whats New ... </h1>
<h3><strong>The following improvements and bugfixes are included in v1.3.9 since v1.3.8: </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>PHP 5.3.x compatibility
