Zen Cart(tm) - The Art of E-Commerce

Welcome to Zen Cart(tm) E-Commerce

THE FOLLOWING IS A VERY SIMPLIFIED INSTALLATION DOCUMENT.
WE SUGGEST YOU USE THE HTML VERSIONS IN THE /docs FOLDER FOR MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS.

ALL OF OUR README DOCUMENTS ARE IN THE /docs FOLDER OF THIS DISTRIBUTION.


You can find online documentation at: http://tutorials.zen-cart.com


Zen Cart has a built-in automatic installation system. However to use this you must first unpack and upload the code to a compatible web server:

1. Extract the Zen Cart(tm) ZIP file (and tell the unzip utility to *retain* folder structures)
2. Upload the Zen Cart files and folders to your server using your FTP program
3. You'll need to make some folders writable. The details are in the HTML-formatted documentation in the /docs/ folder
4. Point your browser to your website where you uploaded the files, specifically to the /zc_install/index.php file.
5. Follow the instructions. You'll need MySQL database credentials, etc to complete installation.

For more detailed installation instructions, please see the /docs/1.readme_installation.html document in this distribution.
